# Wormhole

This is a work-in-progress mobile client for the [magic wormhole][magic-wormhole] protocol. What already works:

- Sending files. The app can obtain a code, exchange keys with the other party, allow the user to pick a file to send down the wormhole, and then actually transfer the file.
- Receiving files. The user can enter a code, view a file offer to confirm or reject, and indeed receive a file. This will be saved in the downloads directory.
- Handling of Android's `ACTION_SEND` intent. The user can share a file via the app, essentially pre-selecting the file in the send screen.

## Setup

In order to leverage the original [magic wormhole][magic-wormhole] package and also because I was curious whether it will even work, the code is written in Python using [Kivy][kivy] and friends.

```sh
# create a virtual environment
# version 3.8 should work
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies
# pip-sync is also fine
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the (too) few unit tests
pytest tests

# run locally
python src/main.py

# run on an android phone
buildozer android debug deploy run logcat
```

If you also feel adventurous about mobile apps in Python.. pull requests are welcome :)
